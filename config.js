        "After earning my bachelor's degree, I moved to The Big Island of Hawai ªi. I worked for SolarCity, designing and installing residential solar systems. I have always been drawn to things spatially, but working at SolarCity made me think about it in an alternate way. I could relate my interests for location, geography, and maps all in a work environment. During my free time, I would traverse the whole island to soak in its geographical beauty, I became so interested in the different features of the island I started mapping the remote locations to help the community. There is no other place like Hawaii!",
